title: It's time to start blogging
---

Hi there,

It's time to start blogging about the technical decisions, issues and problems we constantly overcome while building our beloved neoScores WebApp.

> **neoScores** is one of those companies betting on the standards of the internet. Plain ol' HTML, CSS and Javascript. We strongly believe in the potential and philosophy of the *openness* of the internet:
 - everyone can use it,
 - nobody is controlling it,
 - it's continuously evolving,
 - browsers are auto-updating,
 - offline use is perfectly possible,
 - these days, it's available on everything with a screen

The gap between "Native apps" and "Web apps" is gone! Our friends at [&yet](https://andyet.com/) are evangelising it as ["Native Web Apps" (http://blog.andyet.com)](http://blog.andyet.com/2015/01/22/native-web-apps#native-web-apps)

##Javascript

I'm starting this blog because I think I can share a lot of interesting javascript-knowledge about
 - browser performance,
 - the internet ... "offline"
 - webcomponents
 - cross-[device|OS|browser]-related "bugs" we fixed,
 - the frameworks we use ([Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), [Ampersand.js](http://ampersandjs.com/), [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/), [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org)),
 - our server-architecture in [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) on [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/)
 - and a bit of fun like [Minified JavaScript Craziness](http://aem1k.com) by *Martin Kleppe* aka [@aemkei](http://twitter.com/aemkei)

##Digital Sheet Music Engraving

Another thing I might talk about is our vision on the details of Digital Sheet Music engraving and how we deal with the difficulties of the available file-formats for sheet music.

Thanks to neoScores, we can embed Sheet Music snippets into any other website. Just by adding 2 lines of HTML to you page:
{% highlight html %}
<div data-src="2e2dea609a638e7a23689945db263ed9" class="neoscores-engraver"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://app.neoscores.com/api/1/plugin/neoscores.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
... which comes in handy to show the neoScores-variations of the examples Daniel Spreadbury is describing on his blog [Making notes](http://blog.steinberg.net/). Here's one to start with ;-)
<div data-src="2e2dea609a638e7a23689945db263ed9" class="neoscores-engraver" width="100%" height="360px" data-scale="1.2"></div></p>
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['neoScoresPluginObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','https://app.neoscores.com/js/neoscores.plugin.js','nsPlugin');
  nsPlugin.token='bhamblok';  // Replace 'xxx' with the token we have provided you.
</script>

Cheers,
